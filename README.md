# The "Science Pods" Project

## Get in touch if you are interested

Write to mr.ricardo.pires@gmail.com to let me know if you want to contribute to the project (read more below). This is still very initial work, but what is available may already give you some idea of what we want to achieve. Also, feel free to drop some ideas in case you would like the project to grow along a particular line.

## What is it?

**Science Pods** is a project designed to enable access to 3D printing models that are useful in assembling scientific laboratory experimental setups.

The main goal of **Science Pods** is to make a contribution towards scientific literacy by supporting direct observation and exploration of natural phenomena through the building of 3D-printed based setups we call "Science Pods". Each pod can be thought as an observation island where optical, electronic and 3D printed parts can be combined to collect data, or implement a task that is relevant to undertake a scientific study of a phenomenon. The GitHub **Science Pods** repository stores the original CAD files as well as other details of the 3D printed parts, as well as ancillary information on their use including incorporation in an assembly protocol.

Taking advantage of the widespread use of 3D printers at schools and in the home environment, we wish to become a resource for institutions such as schools, as well as for interested individuals, to make demonstrations of scientific concepts more easily available, and to further entice critical thinking.

## How to do it

To achieve these goals we will be observing the principles of open source sharing, and using tools and methods that enable easy access to content through freely available software.

In addition, **Science Pods** will strive to adopt concepts of shared design language and modularity. Parts downloaded through the **Science Pods** project are expected to have consistency in the design language of features, so that two or more parts that contain features that enable the exact same function should have the same design - unless other constrains or considerations play a relevant role. In other words, we wish to create a system of parts with a high level of modularity in their design, making mixing and matching easier to develop new parts inside a CAD software, but also making it more straightforward to connect pieces once they are printed.

There are many sites and platforms that showcase a myriad of 3D models associated to scientific concepts (e.g., 3D models or organs, cells, molecules, etc.). The **Science Pods** project is not intended to develop along those lines.

Alternatively, one can easily find a variety of models that are designed to perform, or aid in performing, an experimental scientific task (e.g., _optics holders, sample stages_). These models can be a great source of inspiration for this project, but **Science Pods** is not a simple collection of those models either. Because they lack the shared designed language which we seek to develop and standardize they are by default unsuitable. However, with some effort, they can be converted into **Science Pod** models.

## Why this project

Like so many things in life, this project is born out of love and deep interest in the matter, a sense of beauty for what Science has to tell, and a sense of realization in learning science and in teaching it to others.

But **Science Pods** is also derived out of some observations:

1. **PRICE:** Laboratory material is expensive. Even the most simple part, such as a optical support element such as an optical post or lense holder can cost as much as an entire PLA spool from which many of such supports can be printed. With so many schools and homes equipped with 3D printers, there is no need to spend so much in setting up an experiment. Money can be better spent in other things which a 3D printer cannot accurately produce, such as optical material, reagents, etc.

2. **APPLICABILITY:** Many reports have been published for several years demonstrating that 3D printed parts can perform on par with much more expensive alternatives. This is more often demonstrated in relation to a learning environment, but it has been shown also in developing high-end scientific goals.

3. **SOLUTIONS WITH MANY LIMITATIONS** The many 3D models for laboratory parts dispersed across the various platforms are a fantastic display of creativity by scientists, teachers and the whole of the 3D printing community. However, these solutions are sometimes either badly described or are incomplete, which in turn limits their usefulness. In addition, the available files are either difficult to edit (e.g., _.stl , .obj_ formats) or are editable but require expensive proprietary software (e.g., _Fusion 360, Solidworks_), or can be edited by free software but the lack of user friendliness limits its wider access (e.g., _FreeCAD, OpenSCAD_).

## Open Source Tools and Content

Development of the project will rely on the use of software that is freely available for developing CAD projects. Currently there is no single CAD software package around which the 3D printing community would tend to converge to. To facilitate contributions based on existing models, as well as editing parts to fit specific setups, _**only contributions made using freely available software will be accepted.**_ This does not include software for which special free subscriptions are available, for example "student" or "academic" subscriptions, nor time-limited ones (e.g., "trial" subscriptions").

The main goal of focusing on free software is to facilitate file editing, so that elements can be easily merged to form new parts, and files can be easily corrected by other users in case a correction is needed. Thus, anyone wishing to submit STL or OBJ or similar need not apply.

## First Principles

The concept of "Science Pod" can be thought as a mixture of a "_table game_" with an "_optical table_", or an "_**optical table game**_". ðŸ˜œ

A science pod can be envisioned as an experimental setup built upon a set of interlocking tiles that offer support and registration to the assembly of functional modules. Such format is the classical design of optical tables, also known as "breadboards", where elements sitting atop the table can be locked in place to the table underneath them. Typically these setups have a footprint that is much larger than that of the print bead of a 3D printer. Thus, by means of interlocking breadboard tiles, it is possible to expand the size of the pod to that that is most suitable for the project.
